# Gretchen Thompson Results

- [GT's data](https://tsoleary.github.io/projects/ADH/scripts/adh_data.html)

## TSO data

- [Trial day one](https://tsoleary.github.io/projects/ADH/scripts/adh-s_trial.html)
    - ADH-slow at 18.5°C.

- [Preliminary data](https://tsoleary.github.io/projects/ADH/scripts/adh_data_tso.html)
    - Using Gretchen's method
    - ADH-fast & ADH-slow at 18.5°C and 23.5°C.

- [TSO data double enzyme concentration](https://tsoleary.github.io/projects/ADH/scripts/adh_trial_061720.html)
    - Double the number of flies to 160 to try to increase reaction velocities overall. 

- [TSO fractionation](https://tsoleary.github.io/projects/ADH/scripts/adh_tso_frac.html)
    - 240 flies homogenized in 3 mL followed by ammonium sulfate fractionation and reconstition of pellet in 1 mL.
      - All flies were were reconsituted in 1 mL and then desalted, except for...
      - VT-8, VT-10, & Chiapas were reconsituted in ~ 260 uL, desalted, then brought to 1 mL (for only the 23.5°C plates)
        - I will redo these later.
      - 28.5°C plates were only ~ 25°C at the time of the reaction. Need to increase equilibration time.
      
- [TSO fractionation](https://tsoleary.github.io/projects/ADH/scripts/adh_tso_frac_temp_check.html)
    - Increased temperatures with thermocouple check
